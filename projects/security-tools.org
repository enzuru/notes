* Security tools

Security tools that I could write Vala apps for.

** Network Security & Analysis

** nmap - While there are GUI frontends like Zenmap, most serious users prefer the CLI for its full feature set and scriptability
** tcpdump - Wireshark exists for packet analysis, but tcpdump's real-time filtering and lightweight nature make the CLI irreplaceable
** netcat (nc) - No meaningful GUI exists for this versatile networking swiss army knife
** masscan - Ultra-fast port scanner with minimal GUI options

** Vulnerability Assessment

** nikto - Web vulnerability scanner with very limited GUI frontends
** dirb/dirbuster - Directory brute-forcing tools (dirbuster has a Java GUI but it's clunky)
** sqlmap - SQL injection testing tool with no substantial GUI
** hydra - Password brute-forcing tool with only basic GUI attempts

** Forensics & Analysis

** volatility - Memory analysis framework that's primarily CLI-driven
** binwalk - Firmware analysis tool with no proper GUI
** strings - Binary analysis utility that's inherently CLI-based
** hexdump/xxd - Hex editors exist, but these CLI tools are often preferred for scripting

** System Security

** lynis - Security auditing tool that's purely command-line
** chkrootkit/rkhunter - Rootkit detection tools with minimal GUI support
** aide - File integrity checker that's CLI-focused
** fail2ban - Intrusion prevention system managed entirely via CLI/config files

** Cryptography

** hashcat - Password recovery tool with limited GUI options
** john (John the Ripper) - Password cracking tool that's primarily CLI
** openssl - Cryptographic toolkit that's fundamentally CLI-based
