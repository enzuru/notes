* GNU

** Thinking
*** My packages are either trivial to setup (undo-tree) or too opinionated (Lispy)
*** Keep configuration public for educational purposes
*** For anything that is complicated to setup, write a blog post
*** Publish interesting new code as separate packages
*** Continue improving existing code

** Contributions
*** Improve existing code
*** Publish new packages
*** Blog difficult tasks
*** Maintain topical README.md files
*** Stream hackathons

Target advanced Linux users, and not beginners. Someone else can help beginners.
