** Visual language

I need a new visual language for Emacs that is:

- Minimalist
- Doesn't blindly mimic Windows / macOS / GNOME
- Isn't misleading

Let's create a videogame menu using off-the-shelf Emacs visual language.

Should show:

- Create new project
- Currently opened projects
- Variables
- Functions
- Applications
- Mail
- News
