# Notes

This repository contains my live notes written in [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/).

These public notes are written using the [PARA method](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/para) as Org files, whereas my private notes are written using the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) as Markdown files.

As per the PARA method, this repo has `projects`, `areas`, `resources`, and `archives`.

I have made the repository public so that people can track my work, as well as learn how to use org-mode.
