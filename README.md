# Notes

This repository contains my live notes written in [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) and [GNU Hyperbole](https://www.gnu.org/software/hyperbole/) regarding the projects that I am working on.

Unlike most org-mode note repos, I favor the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) note-taking style which emphasizes one topic per file, with hyperlinks between them.

I have made the repository public so that people can track my work, as well as learn how to use Org mode and Hyperbole.

Org mode uses [Org syntax](https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html) whereas Hyperbole buttons are written in Lisp stored in `.hypb` files.
